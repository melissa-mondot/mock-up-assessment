### Questions

1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)
    - I enjoy the React ecosystem, so I decided to go with React/React Router. I chose to work with Sass for usability and readability and React Carousel Minimal because I have used it in the past with success. I used Animate.css, though my intention is to migrate to React Spring.

2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose
    - My struggle was time instead of technology. We had fires up here this weekend making things a little tough. If I had used a something like React-Bootstrap instead of creating my own components I would had completed with time to spare.

3. What you enjoyed the most and why
    - I really enjoy building components and watching the magic happen on the next screen over.
